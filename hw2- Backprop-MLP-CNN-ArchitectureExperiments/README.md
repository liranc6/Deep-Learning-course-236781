# Homework Assignment 2

Faculty of Computer Science, Technion.

## Introduction

In this assignment we'll create a from-scratch implementation of two fundemental deep learning concepts: the backpropagation algorithm and stochastic gradient descent-based optimizers.
In addition, you will create a general-purpose multilayer perceptron, the core building
block of deep neural networks. We'll visualize decision bounrdaries and ROC curves in the context of binary classification.
Following that we will focus on convolutional networks with residual blocks.
We'll create our own network architectures and train them using GPUs on the course servers, then we'll conduct architecture experiments to determine the the effects of different architectural decisions on the performance of deep networks.
